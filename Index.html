      To My Fragile Baby üê• <br>
       I love you sooooooooooo muchhhh <span class="emoji-heart">‚ù§Ô∏è</span> Like I don't even have words to describe
       how much love I have for you. Literallyyyy I didn't think you'd mean this much to me and now you're my whole
       worldddd. 
       in case you still have any doubt, I love you, I'm going to keep loving you no matter what.
I'm never leaving you, so I want you to throw that fear away. I'm willing to keep trying for us at all cost. I don't know how to make you believe that how important you are to me. 
Sometimes, I might be mad, upset , angry and hurt, I might start having second thoughts of loving you but at the end I'm still going to choose to love you uncondentionally because those emotions are just a phase of being silly. 
If i'm being stubborn or not understanding then I want you to be the same and handle it. I can do same for you when you behaving like that. 
I don't know whether you love me or not, but I want to keep working for us even more. 

Btw , I feel so privileged to be loved and cared by you sometimes :) 
you are enough for me baby, I love you superman ü´Ç<br> 
and yeah last but not the least (Not every girls are same),
I promise, either I'll be your partner, or I won't be anything at all.
for sure, I'll be there for you always in your ups & downs. so yeah that's what I want to express :)
<br> Uuuummmmaaaahhhh üòòüíï  <br>  
<br> (I don't think you'll need reassurance from now on, just one click, and you'll get it)
